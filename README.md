## Coding-Basics-Quiz

## Description
I've created a mini coding quiz game, where upon clicking the start button you are asked a few questions about the basics of coding. If the question is answered right you get a point, other wise you are deducted 10 seconds of playing time. At the end of the game, the user is able to log their initials and score.
